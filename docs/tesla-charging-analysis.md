# Tesla Charging Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of actual Tesla wall connector data combined with HEMS energy flows to understand charging patterns and identify real-time control opportunities.

## Tesla Wall Connector Data Analysis

### Actual Charging Patterns (5-minute intervals)

| Date | Tesla kWh | Active Hours | Power Range | Charging Window | Strategy Pattern |
|------|----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 0825 | 17.9     | 6.1h         | 0.3-6.4kW   | 07:30→23:30     | Early+Gaps       |
| 0826 | 17.8     | 7.8h         | 0.4-3.1kW   | 08:00→16:00     | Early+Continuous |
| 0827 | 15.5     | 7.6h         | 0.5-4.1kW   | 08:00→17:10     | Late+Continuous  |

### Power Progression Analysis

**8/25 (Failed Strategy)**:
```
07:30  2.4kW ← Started high power immediately
08-11h 3.0-3.7kW ← Sustained high power early
12:25  0.0kW ← 7-hour gap (wasted solar!)
23:00  1.4kW ← Late night charging (grid power)
```

**8/27 (Better Strategy)**:
```
08:00  1.6kW ← Started conservative
09:50  4.1kW ← Ramped up (battery reached 100%)
11-13h 3.0-4.0kW ← Peak charging with full battery
14h+   0.6kW ← Gradual taper
```

## Charging Strategy Correlation with Battery SOC

### Home Battery State When Tesla Charging Started
- **8/25**: Started 07:30, Home Battery SOC = 20% → Poor coordination
- **8/26**: Started 08:00, Home Battery SOC = 52% → Moderate coordination  
- **8/27**: Started 08:00, Home Battery SOC = 69% → Better coordination

### Power Modulation vs Home Battery Status
```
8/27 SUCCESS PATTERN:
Hour  Tesla_kW  Home_Battery_SOC  Coordination
08h     2.0      69→83%           Low Tesla, home battery charging
09h     2.3      83→100%          Moderate Tesla, home battery filling
10h     1.0      100%             Brief pause (home battery full)
11h     3.3      99%              HIGH Tesla with home battery buffer
12h     2.7      99→93%           Sustained high with home battery support
13h     3.0      93%              Continued aggressive charging
```

**Key Pattern**: Tesla power increased AFTER home battery reached 100%, not before.

## HEMS vs Tesla Data Validation

### Consumption Spike Correlation
```
Hour  Tesla_Actual  HEMS_Spike  Accuracy
11h      3.3kWh      4.0kWh      82%
12h      2.7kWh      3.2kWh      84%  
13h      3.0kWh      3.6kWh      83%
```

**Finding**: HEMS consumption spikes track Tesla charging with 80-85% accuracy. The 15-20% difference represents other high-consumption activities during Tesla charging periods.

### Energy Accounting Validation
```
Date  Tesla_Actual  HEMS_Consumption_Spikes  Ratio
0825     17.9kWh        22.4kWh              0.80
0826     17.8kWh        24.2kWh              0.73
0827     15.5kWh        22.7kWh              0.68
```

**Insight**: HEMS reliably identifies Tesla charging periods but overestimates total by ~20-30% due to concurrent house loads.

## Manual Control Inefficiencies Identified

### Charging Gaps
- **8/25**: 7-hour gap (14h-21h) during peak solar availability
- **8/27**: 40-minute gap (10:15-10:55) when battery reached 100%

### Power Inconsistencies  
- **8/27**: Variation 2.7-3.3kW within peak period suggests imperfect surplus tracking
- **Early tapering**: Dropped to 0.6kW at 14h despite solar available until 16h

### Timing Suboptimalities
- **Late night charging** (8/25): 23h charging uses grid power instead of solar
- **Conservative ending**: Stopped aggressive charging too early vs solar availability

## Real-Time Control Opportunities

### Improvement Potential Quantified
- **Current manual**: 15.5 kWh (8/27 best case)
- **Optimal theoretical**: 17-18 kWh based on available solar hours
- **Gap**: 2-2.5 kWh lost to timing inefficiencies

### Specific Enhancement Areas

**1. Gap Elimination**
- Continuous charging during solar hours (no 40-minute pauses)
- Predictive battery SOC management to avoid charging interruptions

**2. Surplus Utilization**
- Real-time calculation: Solar - house consumption - grid import = Tesla surplus
- Dynamic power adjustment based on actual available energy

**3. Extended Optimization Window**
- Continue charging until solar actually drops (16h) vs conservative 14h stop
- Weather-aware planning for cloud coverage periods

## Power Control Algorithm Insights

### Validated Thresholds
- **Start condition**: Home Battery SOC > 70% (8/27 started at 69% successfully)
- **Conservative phase**: Home Battery SOC < 90% → limit Tesla to ~1.6kW
- **Aggressive phase**: Home Battery SOC ≥ 90% → allow Tesla up to 4kW
- **Rate limiting**: Max 2A change per adjustment cycle

### Tesla Charging Current Conversion
```python
# Validated power levels from actual data
def tesla_power_to_current(power_kw, voltage=200):
    """
    8/27 actual power levels:
    - 1.6kW → 8A (conservative phase)
    - 4.1kW → 20A (aggressive phase, breaker limit)
    """
    target_amps = (power_kw * 1000) / voltage
    return max(6, min(20, int(target_amps)))
```

## Integration Requirements

### HEMS Data Integration
- **Real-time access**: Home Battery SOC (EPC 0xE2), Solar power (EPC 0xE0), Grid flow (EPC 0xE5)
- **Update frequency**: 10-second intervals for responsive control
- **Validation**: Cross-check grid flow for surplus calculations

### Tesla API Integration
- **Control capability**: Set charging current (6-20A range)
- **Status monitoring**: Current charging state, power level, session energy
- **Safety limits**: Breaker protection, rate limiting, emergency stop

### Decision Logic Framework
```python
def calculate_tesla_current(home_battery_soc, solar_w, house_consumption_w, grid_flow_w):
    """
    Real-time Tesla charging current calculation
    Based on validated patterns from actual data
    """
    # Calculate available surplus
    surplus_w = solar_w - house_consumption_w
    
    # Home battery-aware power limits
    if home_battery_soc < 90:
        max_tesla_w = min(surplus_w * 0.4, 1600)  # Conservative
    else:
        max_tesla_w = min(surplus_w, 4000)        # Aggressive
    
    # Grid flow adjustments
    if grid_flow_w > 200:  # Importing
        max_tesla_w = 0    # Stop charging
    elif grid_flow_w < -100:  # Exporting  
        max_tesla_w += abs(grid_flow_w)  # Use export
        
    return tesla_power_to_current(max_tesla_w / 1000)
```

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Daily Performance Indicators
- **Tesla energy captured**: Target 16-18 kWh (weather dependent)
- **End-of-day Home Battery SOC**: Target >80% (vs manual best 80%, failed 35-46%)
- **Grid dependency**: Target <15% daily consumption
- **Charging efficiency**: Tesla kWh / available solar surplus ratio

### Real-Time Validation
- **No charging gaps**: During solar availability windows (8-16h minimum)
- **Power progression**: Conservative → aggressive pattern following Home Battery SOC
- **Grid balance**: Minimize imports, tolerate minor exports for home battery health
