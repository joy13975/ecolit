# EV Charging Optimization Algorithm

## Overview
Real-time EV charging optimization using ECHONET Lite HEMS data. This document covers both current simple policies and future complex algorithms based on analysis of actual charging patterns and home battery coordination strategies.

## Current Implementation vs Future Vision

### **Current Simple Policies (Implemented)**
The current system uses basic grid-flow-based policies that focus primarily on export-following:

#### Current Policy Logic Summary
- **ECO Policy**: Only uses `grid_power_flow`
  - Export > 50W ‚Üí increase charging +1A
  - Import ‚â• 0W ‚Üí decrease charging -2A
- **HURRY Policy**: Only uses `grid_power_flow` 
  - Like ECO but allows import ‚â§ 1000W
- **EMERGENCY Policy**: Always max amps (ignores all metrics)

**Key Point**: Current policies do NOT use `solar_power`, `battery_soc`, or `battery_power` for decision making - they only use `grid_power_flow` as the primary control input.

### **Future Complex Algorithm (Theoretical)**
The analysis below describes a more sophisticated approach that could use all available metrics:

## Data-Driven Strategy

### Battery-First Coordination (Validated Pattern)
Analysis of actual Tesla and HEMS data reveals that battery SOC timing is critical for optimization:

**Success Pattern (8/27)**:
```
08-09h: Battery 69%‚Üí100% (Tesla conservative 1.6-2.3kW)
10-13h: Battery 100%‚Üí93% (Tesla aggressive 2.7-4.1kW)
Result: 80% end-of-day battery SOC, 15.5kWh Tesla charging
```

**Failed Patterns (8/25, 8/26)**:
```
08-10h: Battery 20-60% (Tesla aggressive immediately)
Result: 35-46% end-of-day battery SOC, grid dependency
```

### Future Real-Time Control Algorithm (Not Currently Implemented)

#### Theoretical Core Decision Logic
```python
def calculate_tesla_power(home_battery_soc, solar_surplus_w, grid_flow_w):
    """
    Calculate Tesla charging power based on validated patterns
    
    Args:
        home_battery_soc: Home Battery SOC charge level (%) - NOT EV SOC
        solar_surplus_w: Available solar after house loads (W)
        grid_flow_w: Grid power flow (+import, -export, W)
    
    Returns:
        tesla_power_w: Target Tesla charging power (W)
    """
    
    # Safety: Stop if importing >200W from grid
    if grid_flow_w > 200:
        return 0
        
    # Phase 1: Home Battery Priority (Home Battery SOC < 90%)
    if home_battery_soc < 90:
        # Conservative EV power to preserve solar for home battery
        max_power = min(
            solar_surplus_w * 0.4,  # Max 40% of surplus
            1600                    # Cap at 1.6kW (8A @ 200V)
        )
        
    # Phase 2: Aggressive Charging (Home Battery SOC >= 90%)
    else:
        # Use home battery as buffer for higher EV power
        buffer_power = (home_battery_soc - 85) * 200  # Home battery buffer capacity
        max_power = min(
            solar_surplus_w + buffer_power,
            4000                    # Cap at 4kW (20A @ 200V)
        )
    
    # Export prevention: Boost if exporting to grid
    if grid_flow_w < -100:  # Exporting >100W
        max_power = min(max_power + abs(grid_flow_w), 4000)
    
    return max(0, max_power)

def power_to_amperage(power_w, voltage=200):
    """Convert power to EV charging current"""
    amps = power_w / voltage
    return max(6, min(20, int(amps)))  # EV 6-20A range
```

#### Rate Limiting & Safety (Future Implementation)
```python
class EVChargeController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_amps = 0
        self.last_update = 0
        
    async def update_charging(self, target_amps):
        """Apply rate limiting to prevent rapid changes"""
        now = time.time()
        
        # Limit to 2A change per 30 seconds
        if now - self.last_update < 30:
            max_change = 2
            if abs(target_amps - self.current_amps) > max_change:
                target_amps = self.current_amps + (
                    max_change if target_amps > self.current_amps else -max_change
                )
        
        # Apply the change
        if target_amps != self.current_amps:
            await self.set_ev_current(target_amps)
            self.current_amps = target_amps
            self.last_update = now
```

## Current Implementation (Simple Policies)

### Active Policy Logic
The current system implements simple export-following policies in `/ecolit/charging/policies.py`:

```python
# ECO Policy (current implementation)
def calculate_target_amps(self, current_amps: int, metrics: EnergyMetrics) -> int:
    if metrics.grid_power_flow is None:
        return current_amps
        
    # Grid export is negative, import is positive
    if metrics.grid_power_flow < -self.export_threshold:  # Exporting
        target_amps = current_amps + 1
    elif metrics.grid_power_flow >= 0:  # Importing or balanced
        target_amps = current_amps - 2
    else:  # Small export
        target_amps = current_amps
        
    return self._clamp_amps(target_amps)
```

**Key Point**: Only `grid_power_flow` is used. Home Battery SOC, battery power, and solar power are collected but ignored by current policies.

## Future Implementation Requirements (Theoretical)

### HEMS Data Integration
```python
async def get_hems_data():
    """Poll critical ECHONET Lite data points"""
    try:
        # Real-time energy data
        solar_power = await solar_device.update(0xE0)     # Instantaneous power (W)
        home_battery_soc = await battery_device.update(0xE2)   # Home Battery SOC (%) - NOT EV SOC
        grid_flow = await solar_device.update(0xE5)       # Grid flow (W)
        
        # Calculate house consumption estimate
        house_consumption = estimate_house_load(solar_power, grid_flow, home_battery_soc)
        solar_surplus = solar_power - house_consumption
        
        return {
            'home_battery_soc': home_battery_soc / 100 if home_battery_soc > 100 else home_battery_soc,
            'solar_surplus_w': solar_surplus,
            'grid_flow_w': grid_flow
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"HEMS data error: {e}")
        return None
```

### EV API Integration (Future)
```python
async def control_ev_charging():
    """Main control loop"""
    hems_data = await get_hems_data()
    if not hems_data:
        return
        
    # Calculate target charging power
    target_power = calculate_ev_power(
        hems_data['home_battery_soc'],
        hems_data['solar_surplus_w'], 
        hems_data['grid_flow_w']
    )
    
    target_amps = power_to_amperage(target_power)
    
    # Apply rate limiting and update EV
    await charge_controller.update_charging(target_amps)
    
    # Log decision
    logger.info(
        f"üîã Home Battery: {hems_data['home_battery_soc']:.1f}% | "
        f"‚òÄÔ∏è Surplus: {hems_data['solar_surplus_w']}W | "
        f"üîå Grid: {hems_data['grid_flow_w']:+d}W | "
        f"‚ö° EV: {target_amps}A ({target_power}W)"
    )
